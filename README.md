# opencv-OSRS
This program automates cow farming in Old School RuneScape by leveraging OpenCV and a custom-trained cascade classifier model, which I trained on images of RuneScape gameplay. PyAutoGUI is used to interact with the game through mouse actions, while the image processing runs in real time.
